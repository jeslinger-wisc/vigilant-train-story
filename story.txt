	Dave didn't like that feeling: that feeling one gets when looking out over the
arizonian desert at 6:05 pm as the sun begins to set, last checks before departure begin,
and the realization of a cold fact warps around one's head. It crept up his legs, under 
his skin, and brushed around and against his bones. He had served as a conductor for many
train rides- nearly 300, not counting the years he served in on-board kitchens- and knew
the feeling well. However, even with all of 38 years under his belt, he never could get
quite used to the feeling that someone wasn't going to live to see the next morning.
