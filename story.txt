	Dave didn't like that feeling: that feeling one gets when looking out over the
arizonian desert at 6:05 pm as the sun begins to set, last checks before departure begin,
and the realization of a cold fact warps around one's head. It crept up his legs, under 
his skin, and brushed around and against his bones. He had served as a conductor for many
train rides- nearly 300, not counting the years he served in on-board kitchens- and knew
the feeling well. However, even with all of 38 years under his belt, he never could get
quite used to the feeling that someone wasn't going to live to see the next morning.

	Dave remembered this feeling. Not in the way that one remembers having had a feeling in an abstract and distant past. No, Dave was re-experiencing the ambush that left him the sole survivor of an entire battalion because of this feeling. Dave never considered the ambush to be a repressed memory because he clearly remembered the facts, timeline, images, and smells of the deadly ambush (which Dave talked about frequently much to the horror and of family and psychiatrists alike). Dave was now remembering something that couldn't be written a doctor's notepad: the feeling immediately prior to the ambush of his oblivious battalion. Dave now felt exactly as when he was choosing where to dig his foxhole and had this terrible feeling everyone else was digging in the wrong place. Witnessing the death of hundreds of his comrades isn’t what kept him awake following the war, it was the burning question of “How did I know?” The drugs and the shrinks flushed the question out of Dave’s head by convincing him he was just 'lucky' – or perhaps 'unlucky' -- that no mortars landed on his position. The clear Arizona sky added to clarity of Dave's epiphany but that damned feeling continued to burn in Dave like the coal in the engine room. 'The engine room!' Dave gasped.
